= Eclipse Scout - Docs

This repository is part of the link:https://github.com/eclipse-scout/scout.rt[Eclipse Scout] project.
It contains the source of the documentation items and some demo applications created with the framework.
The documentation is published on link:https://eclipsescout.github.io/[GitHub pages], and you can also find the _Eclipse Scout User Guide_ in the link:https://help.eclipse.org[Eclipse Help Center].

== Organisation of this Repository

* `docs/modules` folder: contains the documentation source.
* `docs/playbooks` folder: contains the playbooks and user interface bundles for the Antora build, see below
* `code` folder: contains demo applications (code snippets in the documentation items are extracted from this code base during the build)

== Build Demo Applications

The demo applications are built with maven.

== Build Documentation

The documentation is built using https://antora.org/[Antora].

There are two build targets:

- Eclipse Scout
- Eclipse Help

=== Windows and Symbolic Links

By default, Windows does not enable the creation symbolic links.
Because of that, git creates a little text file for the symbolic link `docs/modules/common/examples/` â†’ `code/`.
Before building the documentation, replace that file with a real symbolic link, overriding the Windows default.

Create the symbolic link manually using a `cmd` shell run _as administrator_, from the root of the working directory:

[listing]
del docs\modules\common\examples
mklink /d docs\modules\common\examples ..\..\..\code

https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/10194/why-do-you-have-to-be-an-admin-to-create-a-symlink-in-windows[On Stackoverflow] you'll find a link to https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/[a blog post from 2016] explaining that an administrator can enable https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development[Developer Mode] for the local machine, allowing the creation of symbolic links.
At the same time, the blog post warns of potential security issues.

WARNING: This is not recommended!

=== Eclipse Scout

The Eclipse Scout playbook builds the site for link:https://eclipsescout.github.io/[GitHub pages].
It uses the https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-lunr-extension[Antora Lunr Extension] to provide a client-side search.

`eclipse-scout-ui-bundle.zip` :: the special user interface bundle for the site
`local-eclipse-scout-playbook.yml` :: the playbook that uses the files in the working directory

To test your changes, run:

[listing]
npm run build

=== Eclipse Help

The Eclipse Help playbook uses a different user interface bundle without header, footer, navbar, sidebar, table of contents, and so on.

`eclipse-help-ui-bundle.zip` :: the special user interface bundle for sparse pages
`local-eclipse-help-playbook.yml` :: the playbook that uses the files in the working directory

To test your changes, run:

[listing]
npm run build-help

Please note that getting the files into an actual Eclipse release requires more manual steps.
