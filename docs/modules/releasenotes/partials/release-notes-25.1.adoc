== New Build & Runtime Requirements

Scout 25.1 requires at least the following:

* Build and runtime of Scout 25.1 require Java 21 (Java 17 support has been dropped).
* Furthermore, the build requires
** Maven >= 3.9.9
** Node: >= 22.12.0
** Pnpm: >= 9.15.0

== Simplified UiCallback

The API to call TypeScript code from the Java client code has been simplified and streamlined. See the xref:technical-guide:user-interface/ui-callback.adoc[UI Callback technical guide] for more details.

== REST MetaResource version endpoint: IApiVersion removed, new support for build date provider

The `IApiVersion` interface which was references by `MetaResource` operation `/version` was removed.
The API version was never used (e.g. increased) and did not provide any value.
The `MetaResource` operation `/version` still provides info about application name and version.

Additionally, a new `IModuleBuildDateProvider` was introduced, which allows an application to provide its own build date which is then returned as part of the `MetaResource` endpoint `/version`.

The `MetaResource` endpoint `/version` (e.g. `https://<server-url>/api/meta/version?verbose=true`) returns:

----
{
"_type": "suite.MetaVersionInfo",
"applicationName": "My Application",
"applicationVersion": "1.2.34",
"buildDate": "2024-11-20 16:01:32.000"
}
----

== Change keystroke for search and reset button
Changed the shortcut keys for search and reset to a more common key
combination.

[cols="2,1,1"]
|===
|Function |Old keystroke |New keystroke

|Open search in a table page
|F6
|Ctrl-Shift-F

|Reset button (Reset search form)
|Ctrl-F6
|Ctrl-Shift-Z
|===

== ListBox: New Default for MultiSelect

The default for the `multiSelect` property has been changed from `false` to `true`.
If it is true, the user can select all rows at once and check or uncheck them.
Also, when creating a list box with Scout JS, the default is already true, so this makes it more consistent.

== LookupColumn

The `LookupColumn` is a multivalued lookup call column. If editable it opens a popup containing a `LookupBox` in order to select multiple values.
The column supports lookup calls and code types and has a `distinct` property to enforce that the same value is not selected in more than one row.
