= Composite Field

include::common:partial$_header.adoc[]

A composite field is a special type of xref:user-interface/form-field.adoc[Form Field] that contains other form fields.

Typical examples are:

. xref:user-interface/group-box.adoc[Group Box]
. Tab Box
. Sequence Box

Since a form field itself actually can contain other form fields, the composite field is not much more than a marker interface without special abilities.
