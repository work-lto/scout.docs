= Object Factory

include::common:partial$_header.adoc[]

As seen in the xref:technical-guide:user-interface/widget.adoc#creating-a-widget[Creating a Widget], a widget may be created using `scout.create`.
When using this function, the call is delegated to the `ObjectFactory`.

The `ObjectFactory` is responsible to create and initialize a Scout object.
A typical Scout object has an `objectType` and an `init` function.
But actually any kind of object with a constructor function may be created.

If you use a string based object type, objects are created using naming convention by default.
This means when calling `scout.create('scout.Table', model)`, the `scout` namespace is searched for a class called `Table`.
Since `scout` is the default namespace, it may be omitted.
So calling `scout.create('Table', model)` has the same effect.
If there is such a class found, it will be instantiated and the `init` function called, if there is one.
The `model` is passed to that `init` function.
So instead of using `scout.create` you could also use the following code:

[source,javascript]
.Creating an object without the ObjectFactory
----
import {Table} from '@eclipse-scout/core';
var table = new Table();
table.init(model);
----

This will work fine, but you will lose the big benefit of the `ObjectFactory`: the ability to replace existing classes.
So if you want to customize the default `Table`, you would likely extend that table and override some functions.
In that case you need to make sure every time a table is created, your class is used instead of the default.
To do that you have to register your class in the `ObjectFactory` with the `objectType` `Table`.
If `scout.create('Table')` is called the object factory will check if there is a class registered for the type `Table` and, if yes, that class is used.
Only if there is no registration found, the default approach using the naming convention is performed.

In order to register you class, you need a file called `objectFactories` and add that to your JavaScript module (e.g. index.js).
The content of that file may look as following:

[source,javascript]
.Adding a new object factory registration
----
import {CustomTable} from './index';
import {scout} from '@eclipse-scout/core';

scout.addObjectFactories({
  'Table': () => new CustomTable()
});
----

This will simply add a new factory for the type `Table` the the list of existing factories.
From now on `yourproject.CustomTable` will be instantiated every time a `Table` should be created.

NOTE: This replacement also works if `scout.create` is used with class references (which is the recommended approach).
So, `scout.create('Table')` as well as `scout.create(Table)` will return a new `CustomTable`.
